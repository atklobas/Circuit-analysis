# Circuit-analysis

This entire program(except the math library) was written in a few days because we needed a final project for a circuitry class.
The math library was something I had laying around from the last time we tried I re-invent the wheel.

One day when I have time, I'll hook up sage or the like as a math back end so non linear and ac circuits can be analysed.


If you (for some reason) want to use any of the code here, ask.
